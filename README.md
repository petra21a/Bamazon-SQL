# Bamazon-SQL
### GitHub Repository: https://github.com/petra21a/Bamazon-SQL
## Assignment Challenge
In this activity, we created a command-line interface (CLI) Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Technical Approach
The challenges to this assignment were:
* applying the basics of node (env, packages.json) and revisiting APIs from class activities
* working with increasing amounts of asyncronous operations (both mySQL and Inquirer)
* finding a new API to use outside those introduced in the class (cli-table on npm)

## Application Tutorial
Basic setup - note: requires Node.js and MySQL
1. clone the repo from GitHub (link above)
2. run the bamazon.sql script in your SQL interface of choice to build the database and inventory table
3. from a command line run `npm -i` to un-pack dependant packages
3. create/use your own .env file with your credentials for SQL
4. run the script from a command line from within the file location with `node bamazonCustomer.js`
